# ParserProject
In this project, we are implementing a parser for a Python language using CFG with ANTLR.
# Expected Features for the Python Parser:
Deliverable #1

       -Arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,%)
       -Assignment operators (=,+=,-=,*=,/=)
       
Deliverable #2

       -if/elif/else blocks
       -Conditional statements (<,<=,>,>=,==,!=,and,or,not)

Deliverable #3

       -while and for loops
       -Nested structures
       -Support for comments
